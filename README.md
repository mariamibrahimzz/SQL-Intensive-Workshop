# SQL Data Analysis Mastery Workshop 🧠📊

This repository presents an intensive SQL workshop designed to build real-world data analysis skills from the ground up — progressing from beginner-level SQL queries to expert-level data manipulation and reporting techniques.

## 📌 Overview

The project utilizes the [BikeStore](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database/) dataset across multiple CSVs and a SQL dump file, simulating real business use cases. You’ll find structured tasks solved using a variety of tools:

- 📁 CSV File Importation via MySQL/XAMPP  
- 🧪 SQL Queries using `%sql` Magic in Jupyter  
- 🐍 Integration with Python via `pandas.read_sql()`  
- ⚙️ Advanced joins, aggregations, subqueries, and analytical queries
